# goto

I had too many friends so I made the {goto} package

## Installation

You can install the development version of goto like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("moodymudskipper/goto")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(goto)
foo <- function() {
  print("a")
  goto("my label")
  print("b")
  ("my label")
  print("c")
}
foo()
```
